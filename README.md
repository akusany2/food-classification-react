# Getting Started

- Extract the code in a directory or download from https://github.com/akusany2/food-classification-react
- Install the dependencies by the command – npm install or yarn install
- While inside the root of the directory execute – yarn start to run the application locally on the default port 3000.
- We can also serve the static files which are located inside build directory, these are the production-ready application files built by the project.
